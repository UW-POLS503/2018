<p>Please complete the following before Wednesday, March 28, 2018.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sign up for our Slack workplace, <a href="https://uwpolsmethods.slack.com/" class="uri">https://uwpolsmethods.slack.com/</a>. We will use this for announcements, and asking and answering questions in this course. You should have received an invite. If not email the <a href="jrnold@uw.edu">instructor</a> to receive one.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell us about yourself: Complete the pre-course survey. If you are registered for the course, you should have received an email. If not, you can find a link pinned on the <code>#announcements</code> channel of Slack.</p></li>
<li><p>We will use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> for version control and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for distributing, collecting, and commenting on assignments.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> and install git.
You should be able to use defaults for all settings.</li>
<li>Sign up for a GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a> (if you do no already have one).</li>
<li>Tell us what your GitHub username is using the form emailed to you,
or that can be found pinned on the <code>#onboarding</code> channel in Slack.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Download and install the latest version of R.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you have R installed already, check that you have the latest version of R.
As of the start of this course (March 26, 2018), the most recent version of R is <strong>3.4.4</strong>.
You can find this in R:</p>
<pre class="rconsole"><code>$ sessionInf()</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you do not have R or the latest version of it installed, then download it from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(Recommended) Download that install RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition). RStudio is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> that provides a user-friendly interface to R.
If you are proficient with R and have been using another IDE or text editor with R, you can skip this step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you do not have RStudio installed, download and install it from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you already have RStudio installed, check that you have the latest version
by selecting <code>Help &gt; Check for Updates</code> in the menu. Download and install
the newest version if not.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(Recommended) Download and install LaTeX if you donâ€™t have it installed.
You will not need to use LaTeX directly (though I encourage you to use it for academic writing),
but it is needed to create PDFs from R Markdown.
There are multiple LaTeX distributions; install the appropriate one for your operating system.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On MacOS, install <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a>.</li>
<li>On Windows, install <a href="https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex">MikTeX</a>.</li>
<li>On Linux, <code>tex-live</code> is a common LaTeX distribution.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
