<p>Propose a final project.</p>
<div id="submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Submission</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open an issue on that student’s project repository, e.g. <code>https://github.com/studnet/pols-503-2018-project/</code> titled “Proposal”</li>
<li>Since the proposal is short, you can write your proposal in the comment. Alternatively attach a file or reference a text file in your repository.</li>
<li>Assign the issue to the instructors.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The proposal should include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discuss the research question, data, design, and expected methods.</li>
<li>Discuss whether all data for the project is available. Given the compressed time-frame of a quarter, the student should have all necessary data on hand, and ideally the project should minimize the amount of data wrangling.</li>
<li>Discuss current and expected difficulties and problems with the project. This is an opportunity to raise and resolve problems early.</li>
</ol>
</div>
