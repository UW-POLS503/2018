Propose a final project. 

## Submission

1.  Open an issue on that student's project repository, e.g. `https://github.com/studnet/pols-503-2018-project/` titled "Proposal"
2.  Since the proposal is short, you can write your proposal in the comment. Alternatively attach a file or reference a text file in your repository.
3.  Assign the issue to the instructors.

## Instructions

The proposal should include the following:

1. Discuss the research question, data, design, and expected methods.
2. Discuss whether all data for the project is available. Given the compressed time-frame of a quarter, the student should have all necessary data on hand, and ideally the project should minimize the amount of data wrangling.
3.  Discuss current and expected difficulties and problems with the project. This is an opportunity to raise and resolve problems early.
